# C - Hello, World

Project done during  my Software Engineering studies at ALX AFRICA School. It aims to learn about C programming language, understanding the preprocessor, the compiler, the assembler, and some basic code examples to get started with my first c programs.

## Technologies
* C file are written using VI editor
* Scripts written in Bash  version 5.0.17(1)-release
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS

## Files
Some of the following files are scripts and other c files:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `1-compiler` | Compiles a C file but does not link. |
| `2-assembler` | Generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. |
| `3-name` | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. |
| `4-puts.c` | Prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line. |
| `5-printf.c` | Prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line. |
| `6-size.c` | Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. |
| `100-intel` | Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. |
| `101-quote.c` | C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error. |
